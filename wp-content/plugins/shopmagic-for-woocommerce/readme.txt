### What does ShopMagic do?

ShopMagic is an email marketing and follow-up emails plugin for WooCommerce that helps you grow your business with marketing automation by increasing conversions and retaining customers.

Imagine a SaaS-based marketing automation software such as HubSpot, Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, or GetResponse. ShopMagic is much easier to use and it's conveniently built as an extension for WooCommerce stores. You can start using it right away, without lengthy registration process or setup.

ShopMagic is a WooCommerce extension, so you own and have total control over your customers’ and store’s data – forever.

What’s more, you can also easily extend ShopMagic with your additions to suit all your needs.

### Some of the ShopMagic email marketing features supported out-of-the-box

- **Ready-to-use WooCommerce email marketing recipes** - Pre-made email automation templates you can use right away
- **WooCommerce follow-up emails** – Send automatic emails to customers who buy specific products, asking for a review or suggesting other products.
- **WooCommerce custom transactional emails** – Create and send customized emails for every order status (also the ones not supported by default in WooCommerce: pending payment and order cancelled)
- **Emails for WooCommerce custom order statuses** – If you added custom order statuses, you can easily create emails and automations based on them.
- **Customized follow-up emails for different products** – Possibility to create different emails (content and design) for different products.
- **Welcome emails** – Customized welcome emails for new orders or new customer accounts. Send emails after user registration.
- **Emails to employees** – It is possible to send emails to any email address, so you can easily notify your employees about store events, or you can just email yourself with important information about orders.
- **Integration with Mailchimp** – Ability to add customers to Mailchimp lists upon checkout.
- **Customer lists and segmentation** – Create and manage multiple lists, for example, create separate lists for newsletters, special offers, or product announcements.
- **GDPR compliant lists** – Opt-in (the customer has to give permission by checkbox) or opt-out lists (automatic sign up and then the customer can opt-out). For both types, you can add an unsubscribe link in the emails.
- **Advanced guests handling** – If you allow guest orders, it is possible to view a complete list of all customers who did not create an account. All emails and actions will also work for these guests.
- **Email queue** – Built for performance, the queue helps to prioritize all emails and actions triggered by ShopMagic and makes sure that your store stays as fast as possible even if you send lots of emails.

### What types of emails can ShopMagic send?

There are a bunch of formats in which you can send your follow-ups:

- **WooCommerce template emails** – Uses the default WooCommerce template for sending emails.
- **Blank template emails** – Gives you the opportunity to create your own styles.
- **Plain text email** – Perfect for simple, more personalized emails that do not overwhelm.
- **Raw HTML email** – Do you already have an HTML email template? Great. Just paste the HTML code, and you are good to go.

### How does ShopMagic work?

Through email automations. Every automation is built with three parts: Event, Filter and Action.

= Choose an event =

In the event, you decide when the automation should run. It can be an order status change, for example order completed, refunded or even when an order note is added.

= Add segmentation =

Then optionally select a filter and your automation will run only for certain conditions. For example, you can create a follow-up email for selected products. Not assigning a filter, will make your marketing automation global.

= Create your message (or perform an action) =

Time for action. The final step of every automation. In other words, what will happen for the selected Event and Filter. It can be a follow-up email to a customer or adding the customer to Mailchimp list.

= Customize with WooCommerce email shortcodes (placeholders) =

ShopMagic supports a variety of WooCommerce email placeholders. This can help you personalize your emails with customers' data or increase conversions with direct links (e.g. pointing to an unfinished order).

### ShopMagic uses cases

= Who should use ShopMagic? =

Every store owner. It’s a perfect solution whether you want to automate repetitive tasks, create transactional emails or integrate your store with external solutions like Mailchimp, Slack, Postmark, WooCommerce Subscriptions, or Memberships.

= Is it possible to create an unlimited number of automations and send unlimited emails with your plugin? =

Yes! Unlike many SaaS-based platforms, we are not limiting you in any way. You are welcome to send as many follow-up emails as you need, to as many orders/customers as you like.

What’s even better, ShopMagic has built-in logs, so you will have full control over your emails and know what's going on with them.
